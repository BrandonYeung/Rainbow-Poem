The Rainbow (not really) and the Unicorn (maybe) and not the Pony

Purple, a colour thats just kinda there. 
Pink, a sort of okay musical artist, I guess.
Oranges, now this is a fruit I love.
Blue, not actually the colour of water.
Green is the first part of Shrek's skintone.
Indigo, the bookstore in Riocan.
Unicorns don't exist, sorry.
Yellow is the second part of Shrek's skintone.
Red is my favourite colour.
These are the colours of the rainbow, sort of.
And the unicorn that may or may not exist.
No pony.


And they lived, happily ever after.
